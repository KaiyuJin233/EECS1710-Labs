When you click with the mouse, you can draw cubes of different colors in the four separated areas.
For the color of the cube, a random function is used and a value range is specified, so the color of the cube in an area is limited.
The random value function makes the color diverse and efficient, but it is not controllable because we cannot determine the color change of each square.
